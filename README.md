## 🏫 Overview

The goal of this project is to predict housing prices based on various attributes using Ridge and Lasso regression techniques. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using R² scores.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Ames Housing dataset**, which contains 81 columns. Key features include:

- **Id**: Unique identifier for each property
- **MSSubClass**: The type of dwelling involved in the sale
- **LotFrontage**: Linear feet of street connected to the property
- **SalePrice**: The property's sale price (target variable)

### Missing Values Analysis
- **Initial Missing Values**: 
```
Id                 0
MSSubClass         0
MSZoning           0
LotFrontage      259
LotArea            0
...
SalePrice          0
```
- **Missing Values After Handling**: 
```
Id               0
MSSubClass       0
MSZoning         0
LotFrontage      0
LotArea          0
...
SalePrice        0
```

## 🚀 Google Colab Setup

Steps to set up your project in Google Colab:
1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
   - Create a new notebook in Google Colab.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/juhiagarwal2003/RegressNest.git
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```python
   !pip install -r RegressNest/requirements.txt
   ```

## 🎉 Usage

To run the notebook, execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## ✨ Implementation Details

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values by filling numerical columns with mean and categorical columns with mode.
   - Used one-hot encoding for categorical features with fewer than 10 unique values and label encoding for others.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trained Ridge and Lasso regression models and evaluated their performance using R² scores.

## 🎨 Results

### Model Performance
- **R² Score for Ridge Regression**: 0.8366
- **R² Score for Lasso Regression**: -0.0009

### Comparison with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
- **Multiple Linear Regression R² Score**: 0.75
- **Optimal Alpha for Ridge**: 10.0
- **Optimal Alpha for Lasso**: 0.1

### Optimized Model Performance
- **Optimized R² Score for Ridge Regression**: 0.8142
- **Optimized R² Score for Lasso Regression**: 0.0118
